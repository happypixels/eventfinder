# eventfinder
Get your tickets to any concert, sports game or cultural event near you before they run out

## Project description and vision
Eventfinder is a service that lets users follow their favorite artists, football teams, poets or other acts. Whenever tickets are released to relevant acts the user is notified. 

We have a very ambitious goal to make this service available in several countries and to include as much of the cultural scene as possible, as well as most sports games.

Additionally, we'd like to make this project as well maintained and functional as possible. Hopefully, the open source community can help with that.
